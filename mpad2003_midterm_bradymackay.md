# Midterm Project: Exploratory Data Analysis


## What is the dataset? <br>
The dataset is a collection of requests for services that require action by government workers. And I will be specifically taking a look at it's relationship between the date of the requestand it's description, and whether I can find real life for the flow-change <br>

Over the course of the month of august 2024 the City of Ottawa has recorded their requests from civilians through 311 Contact Centre, Client Service Centre, 311 Email, and Web-based Self- Service portal. It features information such as the Type of call, Where the report came from, and it's request ID. it also has over 28 000 entries making it quite the dificult set to piece through

## Getting the Data Yourself

To start on your own journey of analyzing this data you'll need to download the data, to do that you'll follow the link above labeled "The Provided, Reduced Dataset of Only Data From August 2024" and if you're connected to the internet you'll find yourself on this screen:<br> <br>
![](<Screenshot 2024-11-05 105452.png>)
From there you'd want to rightclick to open the little selection menu and then locate "save as" and click that, and now you've officially downloaded the csv file!<br><br>
Now you'll open up a google sheet, name it apropiately and then fine your way to the "file" tab, and from there find the "import" button, once you click on that you'll have to upload the file and wait for it to finish.<br> <br>

Now all there is to do is to set the import location to "Append to current sheet" and your separator type to comma and then just click the import button and your Table should look like this!<br> <br>

### Observations 

Now that we both have the data we can make a couple observations about the content, taking a look at it couple things stand out; the sheer amount of rows, 28538 in the narrowed data to be exact that compared to the 11 columbs it's a huge amount of data to parse through. If you look closely at the dates after scrolling all the way to the bottom you can tell that it doesn't end in august, there is a single datapoint for September first. Other than that outliers though the data looks clean! 
<br><br> a couple things to note though, it's very telling that according to this that over 10% of service requests are still active 3 months later! And beyond that 1% of all requests are cancelled. There are 12 different types of requests, including ones that are non-valued but the only two that are like that are "Property Standards - Grass Long/Weeds." and when we're looking at specific addresses only 2% had more than one service call during the month of august and the place with the most is 99 Cobourg St, "MacDonalds Gardens Park" with 18 calls, because it seems to need a lot of maintenence and is a high traffic grafitti spot.  <br><br>
It makes you wonder, how many calls do they get a day if there are so many entries in just august? does anything specific happen to make the flow of calls increase? what makes a specific place more likely to make calls? I'd think it might be related to the daily events around the location, like a tree falling would get significantly more calls about it.

## 2. Getting Data

Use two hashtag symbols (`##`) to create a level 2 heading like this one.

To include a screen capture, use the sample code below. Your images should be saved in the same folder as your `.md` file.

![](import-screen-capture.png)<br>
*Figure 1: The "Import file" prompt on Google Sheets.*

**Here are examples of functions and lines of code put in grey boxes:**

1. If you name a function, put it between "angled" quotation marks like this: `IMPORTHTML`.
1. If you want to include the entire line of code, do the same thing, albeit with your entire code: `=IMPORTHTML("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"; "table", 5)`.
1. Alternatively, you can put your code in an independent box using the template below:

``` r
=IMPORTHTML("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"; "table", 5)
```
This also shows how to create an ordered list. Simply put `1.` before each item.

## 3. Understanding Data

### 3.1. VIMO Analysis

Use three hashtag symbols (`###`) to create a level 3 heading like this one. Please follow this template when it comes to level 1 and level 2 headings. However, you can use level 3 headings as you see fit.

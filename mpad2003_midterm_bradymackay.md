# Midterm Project: Exploratory Data Analysis


## What is the dataset? <br>
The dataset is a collection of requests for services that require action by government workers. And I will be specifically taking a look at it's relationship between the date of the requestand it's description, and whether I can find real life for the flow-change <br>

Over the course of the month of august 2024 the City of Ottawa has recorded their requests from civilians through 311 Contact Centre, Client Service Centre, 311 Email, and Web-based Self- Service portal. It features information such as the Type of call, Where the report came from, and it's request ID. it also has over 28 000 entries making it quite the dificult set to piece through

## Getting the Data Yourself

To start on your own journeyof analyzing this data you'll need to download the data, to do that you'll follow the link above labeled "The Provided, Reduced Dataset of Only Data From August 2024" and if you're connected to the internet you'll find yourself on this screen:<br> <br>

From there you'd want to rightclick to open the little selection menu and then locate "save as" and click that, and now you've officially downloaded the csv file!<br>

## 2. Getting Data

Use two hashtag symbols (`##`) to create a level 2 heading like this one.

To include a screen capture, use the sample code below. Your images should be saved in the same folder as your `.md` file.

**Here are examples of functions and lines of code put in grey boxes:**

1. If you name a function, put it between "angled" quotation marks like this: `IMPORTHTML`.
1. If you want to include the entire line of code, do the same thing, albeit with your entire code: `=IMPORTHTML("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"; "table", 5)`.
1. Alternatively, you can put your code in an independent box using the template below:

``` r
=IMPORTHTML("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"; "table", 5)
```
This also shows how to create an ordered list. Simply put `1.` before each item.

## 3. Understanding Data

### 3.1. VIMO Analysis

Use three hashtag symbols (`###`) to create a level 3 heading like this one. Please follow this template when it comes to level 1 and level 2 headings. However, you can use level 3 headings as you see fit.
